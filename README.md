# Admin panel

My take on the odin project's [Admin Dashboard](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) assignment.

Feel free to try it for yourself [here](https://mohammad-amin-khajeh.github.io/admin-panel/).

**note**: I did not attempt to make this assignment responsive, mobile-friendly, and polished. I treated it mostly as a problem solving challenge.
